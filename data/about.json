  "bio": "<p>I am Travis Frazier. Front-end Developer. Freediver. Traveler. Musician. Hardcore adventurer. Devoted husband. Pretend Marine Biologist.</p>\n\n<p>I am passionate about creating user interfaces for web and mobile. My strengths include HTML5, SASS, and JavaScript. I also enjoy the challenge of writing my own CSS without the use of Bootstrap and I am very comfortable manipulating the DOM with vanilla JavaScript.</p>\n\n<p>Continual education and being relevant on new trends are both very important to me and currently I'm focusing on Vue.js. It's not uncommon to find me coding through the weekends or on the road.

I am eager to apply my experience and skills to better your company or project!</p>",
